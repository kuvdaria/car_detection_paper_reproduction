# Car Detection from Aerial Images with Faster R-CNN and YOLOv3

This repository contains files that were used to reproduce the following paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.10968
Datasets were taken from https://github.com/aniskoubaa/car_detection_yolo_faster_rcnn_uvsc2019 and https://github.com/jekhor/aerial-cars-dataset

## To train Faster R-CNN follow the ipython notebook from the Faster R-CNN folder in Google Colab
